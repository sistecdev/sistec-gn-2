The Department also tries to inculcate moral and ethical values in students through different activities and sessions. A spirit of teamwork is embraced by involving students in various technical & co-curricular activities.</p> <p>The department is always at the forefront when it comes to technology and keeping itself abreast with the newer happenings.</p>",

   "ce" => "<p>Civil engineering is a people serving profession. Civil engineering deals with the planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance and research of fixed structures and infrastructures such as buildings, highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, dams and airports. What lured about this profession was the fact that it is improving the lives of people. By continuously developing and upgrading the services and facilities of the public, it not only gives the Engineer a sense of responsibility towards humanity but brings forth a sense of satisfaction that the work carried out by the Civil Engineer contributes significantly to the wellbeing of the society. Civil Engineers are an integral part of society, without them, we would have no roads, airports, buildings, dams, harbours etc.</p>",
