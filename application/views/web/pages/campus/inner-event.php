                  Sagar Group of Institutions - SISTec celebrated the 76th Independence day which was declared Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav in all parts of India. It was no less a fortune to witness and live this festival of independence that symbolizes the power of liberty, freedom and democracy.

                  The programme began with flag hoisting ceremony by all the dignitaries followed by the address by Dr. Keshavendra Choudhury (Principal- SISTec) in which he took to awe the impactful vibrance of tricolor in the flag of India. He also mentioned the need of strong resolution with sheer honesty to carve the way of new India. Dr. Kuldeep Ganju (Principal - SIPTec) in his speech said that Indians were never slaves but in restriction because a lion can be caged but never be made a slave. He added that now when we are free and independent, it is still important to be restricted by duties and responsibilities for the upliftment of the society.

                  To make the event memorable, SISTec initiated 'Plastic Free Campaign' by launching eco-friendly jute bags of Sagar Group. Mr. Rakesh Dangi then recited a heart touching poem on the plea of a soldier to break the news of his martyrdom only through symbolism. Towards the end, the gathering accelerated the energy by singing patriotic songs together. Some of them were Maa tujhe salaam, Ae mere watan ke logon, Mere desh ki dharti. Loud chant of Bharat Mata ki jai and Vande Mataram resonated in the campus from time to time which was the ultimate sign of pride and love on being the citizens of India.
