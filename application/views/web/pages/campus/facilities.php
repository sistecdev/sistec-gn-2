                        NITI AAYOG has selected Sagar Public School to establish its pet project Atal Tinkering Lab (ATL). This verbalises the volumes about the School’s appetite for innovation and its pedagogy. With the setting up of ATL, the students of SPS now have a colossal canvas to ideate and learn innovative and emerging technologies. ATL is a dedicated workspace where students in middle school and above learn innovation skills and develop ideas that will go on to transform India. The ATL is powered to acquaint students with state-of-the-art equipment such as 3D printers, robotics & electronics development tools, IoT & sensors etc. The lab activities are designed to spur the spark of ingenuity, and transcend conventional curriculum and textbook learning. The lab will enable the students to venture into 21st century skills such as design and computational thinking, adaptive learning, and artificial intelligence.
