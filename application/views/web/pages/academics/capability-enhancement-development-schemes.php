                              The students are tracked during their academic journey in the college and special efforts are made to bring slow learners (students with certain limitations) to come at par with the average/above average group.

                              During admission process the Institute collects fresher students’ data through a registration form. It portraits students profile and this data helps to know the student’s academic and family background, skills learnt in school/junior college, the hobbies/interest in various fields. Learning level of each student is evaluated by analyzing the data in two different stages.

                              In the first stage, on the basis of the performance of in their intermediate examination subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics as well as English, the first year entrants are categorized as advanced and slow learners. Students who obtain 70% average marks are considered as advanced learners otherwise the slow learners.

                              In the second stage, two unit tests of 35 marks are conducted for two chapters of every subject to assess performance with a scale of 20 marks out of 35 as a part of semester continuous assessment.

                              The First Year learning level data is shared with the team of first year Tutor Guardians to evaluate the student learning level as advanced learner or slow learner. The TGs, in weekly meetings with all faculties of respective classes, carry out discussion based on analysis records available about students’ levels, abilities, characteristics, skills, attitudes, examination results (internal and external) and their current day to day interactions/experiences. Based on this evaluation, feedback is given to students and special programs/activities are undertaken.

                              This data analysis done at entry stage is referred by TGs of FY classes and also passed subsequently to TGs of next classes. The TGs of second year onwards carry forward the FY activities at individual departments. Students attendance is also being monitored through ERP software on every week and list of defaulter students are displayed on department notice board. Attendance of students is regularly being informed to the parents through SMS facility. College had made special provision of exhaustive soft skill training and exclusive counseling, to mould the slow and advanced learners to plan their careers and placements. Through this process slow learner are identified and following activities are carried out for them.

                              SISTec conducts Refresher Course, Communication Skills classes, bridge course in maths. Remedial classes are organized to clarify doubts for backlogs and for current subjects (if their performances in quizzes and mid semester exam are not up to the mark). Make up classes are also arranged outside the regular working hours and days to enable the students to achieve on par with others. All this is planned and incorporated in the timetable itself. More tutorials with improved student – staff ratio are conducted as and when required.

                              Mentoring is done in a sympathetic manner to improve the morale of the student. The students are persuaded to stay in the hostels and faculty arranges the evening classes as well skill development modules.

                              Effective practice of Tutor-guardian scheme is providing the welfare and overall career growth of the students. The role of TG is to monitor academic performance and interact frequently to understand and assist any student with issues that affect their ability to learn or impeding their academic success. Set of 15-20 students are assigned for a faculty as TG and personal and academic care is completely taken by the corresponding TG. TG communicates regularly with parents and alert regarding performance of students.

                              Good communication skills are indispensable for the success of any professional. English language has become essential in the lives of young people who aspire to advance their careers anywhere in the world. Being able to communicate well is the most important factor when seeking a placement in a company or institution. As it is a technological aid for learning, it has a number of advanced facilities that can help a student to learn a language with proficiency to communicate and in SISTec, we contemplate on the same.

                              The language laboratory is very useful for assessing students’ speech. It provides students with the technical tools to get the best samples of pronunciation of the language. Language lab allows students to emphasize material learned in class by putting them into practice through interactive activities. The language laboratory helps students to use technology effectively to communicate. It helps them to learn pronunciation, accent, stress and all other aspects of the phonetics of a language.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              The devices of laboratory help students to acquire the language quickly and easily. The language laboratory offers broadcasting, television programmes, web-assisted materials and videotaped off-air recordings in the target language. Students learn much faster in the language lab using listening skills.

                              The tutor guardian (T.G.) scheme is an innovative concept brought in for the overall benefit of the students. Under this scheme, about 15-20 students are placed under the care of one member of the teaching staffs, who acts as a tutor guardian for these students to look after their needs and deals with difficulties at both academic and non-academic front.

                              A Tutor Guardian is always there to aid and guide students in all spheres i.e. academic, personal or social. A TG also monitors the students’ academic performance throughout the semester and informs the same to the parents about their ward’s performance to facilitate counseling and appraisal.
